# Singleton Pattern

**Intent**: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

For this use case, can navigate to 01.singleton folder. We can see that in the start folder, there are multiple files are utilising the logger class, but if we try to run index.js, we can see that there are multiple logger instances are being created instead of using the same instance.

In the finish folder, that is the solution for that utilising singleton pattern

## Key Goals of the Singleton Pattern
- Ensure a single instance: **Prevents the instantiation of more than one instance of a class**.
- Provide a global access point: Offers a global point of access to the instance.

## How the Singleton Pattern Works
- Private Constructor: Prevents direct instantiation from outside the class.
- Static Instance: Holds a single instance of the class.
Public Static Method: Provides a way to access the instance.

# Prototype Pattern

**Intent**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype

The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that aims to:

- **Reduce the cost of creating objects**: Instead of creating a new instance from scratch using a constructor, the Prototype pattern allows for the **creation of new objects by copying an existing object**, known as the **prototype**. This can be more efficient, especially for objects that are expensive to create.

- **Simplify the process of object creation**: By using a prototype, you **avoid the complexities involved in creating a new object from scratch**, particularly when it involves multiple steps or complex configurations.

- **Enable runtime flexibility**: The Prototype pattern allows for the dynamic addition and removal of objects at runtime, as you can **clone existing objects and modify them without altering the code** that uses these objects.

## How the Prototype Pattern Works
- Prototype Interface: Defines a method for cloning itself. This method is often called clone or copy.
- Concrete Prototype: Implements the clone method, allowing for the duplication of itself.
- Client: Uses the prototype to create new objects by cloning existing ones.

# Factory Pattern
**Intent**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subClasses

## Key Goals of the Factory Method Pattern
- Encapsulate Object Creation: Decouple the client code from the specific classes it needs to instantiate.
- Promote Flexibility and Scalability: Allow subclasses to determine which class to instantiate.
- Encourage Code Reuse: Reduce duplication of object creation logic.

## How the Factory Method Pattern Works
- Product: Defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.
- Concrete Product: Implements the Product interface.
- Creator: Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. The Creator may also define a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default ConcreteProduct object.
- Concrete Creator: Overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.

# Builder Pattern
**Intent**: Seperate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations

## Key Goals of the Builder Pattern
- Encapsulate Construction: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- Flexibility: Allow different representations of an object to be created using the same construction process.
- Step-by-Step Construction: Build an object step by step, with the option to create an incomplete representation.

## How the Builder Pattern Works
- Product: The complex object being constructed.
- Builder Interface: Specifies methods for creating the parts of the Product object.
- Concrete Builder: Implements the Builder interface and provides specific implementations for building parts of the Product.
- Director: Constructs an object using the Builder interface. Itâ€™s optional but useful for managing the construction process.
Client: Uses the Director and Builder to construct the Product.
